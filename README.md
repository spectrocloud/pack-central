## Contributing
We welcome contributions of new packs and updates to existing packs. This repository uses a fork and pull model. Here are the steps for becoming a contributor:

  * Fork this repository and create a new branch.
  * In the packs/ directory, add your changes.
  *  If you are adding a new pack, then create a directory having the format <name of the pack>-x.y.z, where x is the major version, y is the minor version and z is the patch version. If your name of the pack has multiple words, use ‘-’ as the separator while naming the top level directory of the pack.
  * Push your pack changes to your private registry and test it in your Palette environment.
  * Push your changes to your fork, then open a pull request against this repository.
  * While opening a pull request, mention the purpose of the pack and the scenarios that have been validated.
  * If you are making changes that address an existing issue, please make a comment in the issue so we can assign it to you. This helps to prevent accidentally doubling up on work.
  * If you already have a pack and working on a new version for it, retain the name and display name of the pack across versions. Else, it will show up as a new pack.

## Pull Request guidelines
* Be sure to test your functionality by uploading the pack to your own pack registry before raising the pull request.
* Use the [README template](templates/README-template.md) to create a README.md file for your pack that includes a brief overview of the pack functionality, prerequisites, and usage instructions. Each pack version should have its own README.md file. An [example README.md](templates/README-example.md) is also available to provide you with a better understanding of the structure and content you need to include.
* Mention the list of container images being used by your pack as part images section in values.yaml file of the pack. This will help us in identifying the images to run security scans.

* Once your PR is merged, it will be deployed to the Spectro Cloud public pack registry.
