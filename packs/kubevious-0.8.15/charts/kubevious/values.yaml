worldvious:
  ## Disables version check. As a part of the version check, Kubevious deployments
  ## are added to the leaderboard at https://worldvious.io. Reporting is anonymized
  ## to the nearest city. No IP address is stored or logged. We calculate the SHA256
  ## hash of the IP address and use it as a key. As a part of this request, we also
  ## added news notification and a feedback request mechanism.
  opt_out_version_check: false
  ## Disables automatic exception and error reporting.
  opt_out_error_report: false
  ## Disables periodic reporting of cluster metrics, such as: number of nodes, pods,
  ## ingresses, configmaps, etc. The number of pods and nodes would appear on the
  ## https://worldvious.io leaderboard. Those are the same counters you would see in
  ## the console log of kubevious and parser pods.
  opt_out_counters_report: false
  ## Disables periodic reporting of internal time metrics. In conjunction with counters
  ## reporting, this would help identify internal bottlenecks and improve overall
  ## performance. Those are the same metrics you would see in the console log of kubevious
  ## and parser pods.
  opt_out_metrics_report: false
  ## Opt out from all of the above reportings.
