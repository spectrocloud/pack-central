These helmfiles are located in the DPF repository under deploy/helmfiles and are used to deploy the DPF operator components.

After applying the prereqs.yaml you MUST ensure that the KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST and KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT
environment variables are set in the node-feature-discovery-worker DaemonSet.
NFD needs to target the VIP because it needs to be up before cluster services can work.

Example commands to set the environment variables:

kubectl -n dpf-operator-system set env daemonset/node-feature-discovery-worker \
  KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST=<vip> \
  KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT=<port>
