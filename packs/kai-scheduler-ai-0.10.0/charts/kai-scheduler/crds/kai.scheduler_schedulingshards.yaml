                  Args specifies custom CLI arguments for the scheduler. These are merged with automatically generated flags.
                  Valid flags are those defined in the scheduler's code. Usage examples:
                  - To pass "--custom-flag=value": Args: {"custom-flag": "value"}
                  - To override default flags like "--leader-elect": Args: {"leader-elect": "true"}
                  Note:
                    * Flag names must match exactly (case-sensitive)
                    * Values are passed as strings
                    * Only valid flags defined in the scheduler's flag set will be accepted
                    * Duplicated flags will override the behavior of flags generated by other fields
