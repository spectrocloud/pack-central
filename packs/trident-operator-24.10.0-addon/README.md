# NetApp-Trident
Trident is a fully supported open source project maintained by NetApp. It has been designed from the ground up to help you meet your containerized applications' persistence demands using industry-standard interfaces, such as the Container Storage Interface.

Trident deploys in Kubernetes clusters as pods and provides dynamic storage orchestration services for your Kubernetes workloads. It enables your containerized applications to quickly consume persistent storage from NetApp's broad portfolio that
includes ONTAP, Element, HCI/SolidFire, as well as the Azure NetApp Files service, Cloud Volumes Service on Google Cloud, and Amazon FSx for ONTAP.

Trident features also address data protection, disaster recovery, portability, and migration use cases for Kubernetes workloads leveraging NetApp's industry-leading data management technology for snapshots, backups,
replication, and cloning.

## Prerequisites
For a full list of Trident requirements, check out the [Getting Started](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-get-started/requirements.html) guide. 

Critical information about Trident:
* Kubernetes 1.31 is now supported in Trident. Upgrade Trident prior to upgrading Kubernetes.
* Trident strictly enforces the use of multipathing configuration in SAN environments, with a recommended value of find_multipaths: no: in multipath.conf file.

Supported frontends (orchestrators)
Trident supports multiple container engines and orchestrators, including the following:
* Anthos On-Prem (VMware) and Anthos on bare metal 1.16
* Kubernetes 1.25 - 1.31
* OpenShift 4.10 - 4.17
* Rancher Kubernetes Engine 2 (RKE2) v1.28.5+rke2r1

The Trident operator is supported with these releases:
* Anthos On-Prem (VMware) and Anthos on bare metal 1.16
* Kubernetes 1.25 - 1.31
* OpenShift 4.10 - 4.17
* Rancher Kubernetes Engine 2 (RKE2) v1.28.5+rke2r1

Trident also works with a host of other fully-managed and self-managed Kubernetes offerings, including Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Services (EKS), Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Mirantis Kubernetes Engine (MKE), and VMWare Tanzu Portfolio.

Supported backends (storage)
To use Trident, you need one or more of the following supported backends:
* Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP
* Azure NetApp Files
* Cloud Volumes ONTAP
* Google Cloud NetApp Volumes
* FAS/AFF/Select 9.5 or later
* NetApp All SAN Array (ASA)
* NetApp HCI/Element software 11 or above
