# Usage

StormForge Optimize Live applies machine learning to your existing observability metrics to make real-time, actionable recommendations to resource settings for any deployment running in Kubernetes. Save cloud resources and money, reduce the business risk of poorly performing applications, and get your developers focused on innovating, not tuning your Kubernetes environment.

You can use Stormforge with all the Palette-supported infrastructure providers.
