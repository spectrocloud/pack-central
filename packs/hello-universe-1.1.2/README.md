# Hello Universe

[Hello Universe](https://github.com/spectrocloud/hello-universe) is a demo web application utilized to help users learn more about [Palette](https://docs.spectrocloud.com/introduction) and its features.

You can deploy it using two preset configurations: 
- A standalone front-end application. It provides a click counter that is saved locally and displays Spectro Cloud themed images.
- A three-tier application with a front-end application, API server and PostgreSQL database into a Kubernetes cluster. It provides a click counter that is saved in the deployed database and displays Spectro Cloud themed images. You can read more about this configuration on the Hello Universe [README](https://github.com/spectrocloud/hello-universe?tab=readme-ov-file#reverse-proxy-with-kubernetes).

## Prerequisites

- A Palette account.

- A cluster profile where the Hello Universe pack can be integrated.

- A Palette cluster with port `:8080` available. If port 8080 is not available, you can set a different port in the **values.yaml** file.

- If you are using the **Enable Hello Universe API** preset, you will need the `:3000` port available on your cluster too. Check out the [Usage](#usage) section for further details.

- Ensure sufficient CPU resources within the cluster to allocate a minimum of 100 milliCPU and a maximum of 200 milliCPU per replica.

## Parameters

The following parameters are applied to the **hello-universe.yaml** manifest through the **values.yaml** file. Users do not need to take any additional actions regarding these parameters.

| `manifests.images.hellouniversedb` | The [`hello-universe-db`](https://github.com/spectrocloud/hello-universe-db) application image that will be utilized to create the containers.          | `ghcr.io/spectrocloud/hello-universe-db:1.0.2` | No           |
| `manifests.apiEnabled`                  | The flag that indicates whether to deploy the UI application as standalone or together with the API server. | `false`                                      | Yes           |
| `manifests.port`                  | The cluster port number on which the service will listen for incoming traffic. | `8080`                                      | Yes           |
| `manifests.replicas`              | The number of Pods to be created.                                              | `1`                                         | Yes           |
| `manifests.dbPassword`           | The base64 encoded database password to connect to the API database.           |            `REPLACE_ME`                                 | No          |

## Upgrade

Upgrades from the [hello-universe-1.1.1](../hello-universe-1.1.1/README.md) pack are not supported. If you want to upgrade the pack, you must first remove it from the cluster profile. Then, you can add the upgraded version as a cluster profile layer.

## Usage

The Hello Universe pack has two presets that you can select:
- **Disable Hello Universe API** configures Hello Universe as a standalone frontend application. This is the default configuration of the pack. 
- **Enable Hello Universe API** configures Hello Universe as a three-tier application with a frontend, API server, and Postgres database.

To utilize the Hello Universe pack, create either a [full Palette cluster profile](https://docs.spectrocloud.com/profiles/cluster-profiles/create-cluster-profiles/create-full-profile) or an [add-on Palette cluster profile](https://docs.spectrocloud.com/profiles/cluster-profiles/create-cluster-profiles/create-addon-profile/) and add the pack to your profile. You can select the preset you wish to deploy on the cluster profile creation page.

If your infrastructure provider does not offer a native load balancer solution, such as VMware and MAAS, the [MetalLB](https://docs.spectrocloud.com/integrations/metallb) pack must be included to the cluster profile to help the LoadBalancer service specified in the manifest obtain an IP address.

After defining the cluster profile, use it to deploy a new cluster or attach it as an add-on profile to an existing cluster.

Once the cluster status displays **Running** and **Healthy**, access the Hello Universe application through the exposed service URL along with the displayed port number.
