Thank you for installing {{ .Chart.Name }}, which will deploy and manage NetApp's Trident CSI
storage provisioner for Kubernetes.

Your release is named '{{ .Release.Name }}' and is installed into the '{{ .Release.Namespace }}' namespace.
Please note that there must be only one instance of Trident (and trident-operator) in a Kubernetes cluster.

To configure Trident to manage storage resources, you will need a copy of tridentctl, which is
available in pre-packaged Trident releases.  You may find all Trident releases and source code
online at {{ .Chart.Home }}.

To learn more about the release, try:

  $ helm status {{ .Release.Name }}
  $ helm get all {{ .Release.Name }}
