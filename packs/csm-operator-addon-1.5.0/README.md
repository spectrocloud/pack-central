# Description
Dell Technologies Container Storage Modules (CSM) Operator is an open-source Kubernetes operator which can be used to install and manage various CSI Drivers and CSM Modules.

CSI capabilities per driver can be found [here](https://dell.github.io/csm-docs/docs/csidriver/)
Supported components can be found [here](https://dell.github.io/csm-docs/docs/deployment/csmoperator/#supported-csm-components)


# Kubernetes versions supported:
Above 1.26

# Constraints:
Support for PowerFlex, PowerMax and PowerStore is available.
Support for PowerScale and UnityXT is not available at this time.

Please see [here](https://dell.github.io/csm-docs/docs/deployment/csmoperator/drivers/) for installation prereqs. For PowerFlex, PowerMax and PowerStore you typically need to install either the ScaleIO driver (PowerFlex) and/or Multipath, as well as iSCSI packages if iSCSI is used. The Dell page linked above contains information on these prereqs, which will need to be added to the OS layer in the cluster profile.

# Cloud types supported:
This pack was designed to be used with clusters on Canonical MAAS

### Usage

Dell Container Storage Modules Operator is a Kubernetes native application which helps in installing and managing CSI Drivers and CSM Modules provided by Dell Technologies for its various storage platforms. Dell Container Storage Modules Operator uses Kubernetes CRDs (Custom Resource Definitions) to define a manifest that describes the deployment specifications for each driver to be deployed.

`StorageClass` are created and set as default. This creates the storageclass `vxflexos` for `powerflex-v2100`, `powermax` for `powermax-v2100` & `powerstore` for `powerstore-v2100`.

### CSM Snapshot Controller Creation

The Dell Container Storage Modules Operator pack supports snapshot controller creation. After selecting the right `Platform` **preset**, modify the parameter `charts.csm-operator.snapshot-controller.enabled` to enable the controller snapshotter for `powerflex-v2100`, `powermax-v2100` &  `powerstore-v2100`. Default value is `true`.

### CSM Volume Snapshot Creation

The Dell Container Storage Modules Operator pack supports creation of volume snapshots. After selecting the right `Platform` **preset**, modify the parameter `charts.csm-operator.snapshot-controller.volumeSnapshotClass.create` to enable the creation of `VolumeSnapshotClass` for `powerflex-v2100`, `powermax-v2100` &  `powerstore-v2100`. By default, it is `true` for `powerflex-v2100` &  `powerstore-v2100`. By default, it is `false` for `powermax-v2100`

### CSM Webhook Snapshot Creation

The Dell Container Storage Modules Operator pack supports snapshot volume creation. After selecting the right `Platform` **preset**, modify the parameter`charts.csm-operator.snapshot-controller.webhook.enable` to enable the snapshot webhook for `powerflex-v2100`, `powermax-v2100` &  `powerstore-v2100`. By default it is `true` for `powerflex-v2100`, `powermax-v2100` &  `powerstore-v2100`.
